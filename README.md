# DecisionTreeClassifier
Decision tree classifier implementation using [TDIDT](http://www.cs.utsa.edu/~bylander/cs6243/decision-tree.pdf) (Top-Down Induction of Decision Trees) algorithm based on information gain heuristic, for continuous attributes.

Trained the classifier on Kaggle's [Breast cancer dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data), and achieved 99.5% accuracy on training data and 94.7% accuracy on test data.


The resulting plot of the decision tree trained on the above dataset for maximum depth of 5:
